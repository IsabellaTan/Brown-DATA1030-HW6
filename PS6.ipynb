I.e., if your model predicts that the opening price of the apple stock tomorrow will be higher than the closing price today, you'd put in a sell order at the end of the day. If your prediction is correct, you will make a profit in USD once your order executes at tomorrow's open.

If your prediction is correct, you'll buy at a low price once your order executes at tomorrow's open. This is how you'd act based on the model's prediction - buy low, sell high.
